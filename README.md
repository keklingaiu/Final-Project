# Diamond Dash
-
## Final Project
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, December 3 2020

## Theme
- The player is 'under pressure' in a coal mine to escape to the next levels before the time runs out and collect diamonds (part of the under pressure theme) to earn score. On top of all that pressure the player is under, they must navigate around or kill the enemies blocking their way out of the coal mine.

## Game Play
- The objective is to collect as many diamonds as you can and make it to the exit door of the coal mine before the time runs out!

- Instructions:
  - Use 'A' to move left
  - Use 'D' to move right
  - Use 'W' to jump
  - Use 'Space' to throw a bomb at the enemies
  - Clicking the 'Play' button on any menu screen resets the level back to the beginning
  - Clicking the 'Quit' button on any menu screen will close the game
  - Collect all the diamonds by colliding with them
  - You lose a life if the enemies touch you
  - You lose if you run out of lives, or if the time runs out

## Impediments
- The main struggle was working with GitHub and allowing us all to access the files to work on them. 
- The player wasn't dieing when the enemies touch it, but turns out the collision box was just too small on the enemies
- The timer was also a little tricky to get, because it was trying to set the timer before the game started, but we got it to work
